# CVPR
The KNN code utilizes the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The program starts by reading training images from a directory and creating a list called TRAIN_DATA, which includes image arrays and their class labels. The list is shuffled randomly, and a subset of 50 images with their class labels is displayed. The training data is then split into five sections or folds, with one fold used for validation and the remaining four folds for training. Two distance metrics (L1 and L2) are employed to compute distances between validation and training images. The algorithm's accuracy is determined for k values ranging from 2 to 9, and the average is calculated. Our aim is to enhance the naturalness and safety of AI systems, and your input will assist us in achieving this goal.
